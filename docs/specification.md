**Overview**
------------

These specifications were assembled with the following references:

- [*CENTRE Fiat Token design*](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/78d964a1a8d481ffd8152772d7a66e47df54b3db/doc/tokendesign.md) which is served as a reference specification to tezos stablecoin smart contract.

- Tezos Token Standard:
  [*FA2*](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/76d5f3791bfbfe3c9bf95ad5ec5fc6cbeeca2d0e/proposals/tzip-12/tzip-12.md) and
  [*ManagedLedger*](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/blob/ae2f1e7ebb3454d811a2bea3cd0698b0e64ccea5/proposals/tzip-7/ManagedLedger.md)

- [*Michelson Contract Interfaces and Conventions*](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/blob/ae2f1e7ebb3454d811a2bea3cd0698b0e64ccea5/proposals/tzip-4/tzip-4.md) TZIP which defines `view` and `void` type synonyms

**General Requirements**
------------------------

- The token(s) must be and FA2 compatible as to facilitate listing on
  exchanges and interaction with services which support FA2

**Ledger**
==========

Every address that is stored in ledger is associated with its
current balance, token id and current minting allowance.

**Roles**
=========

The token supports the following list of user roles as is described in
CENTRE Fiat Token specification and the taxonomy of permission policies that are described in FA2 token specification.

<!-- Here're the roles that are present in current version of stablecoin token.  -->

Below we define some roles for stablecoin contract token.

**owner**

- Can re-assign any role of the token.

**masterMinter**

- Can add and remove minters.

- Can change minting allowance for any minter if that is present in
  its list of minters.

- Stores the list of current minters within itself, rather
  than exposing the map of master minter and its minters globally
  for the whole token.

**minter**

- Can create and destroy coins (that are allowed by their current
  minting allowance).

- Minting allowance is stored locally within the address
  allowing for multiple minters creating and destroying tokens.

**pauser**

- Can pause transferring, burning and minting operations.
  During the pause, these operations cannot be performed
  and fail with an error if the user decides to try them.

**blacklister (TBD)**

- Can blacklist a particular address preventing it from
  transferring, minting, burning and receiving tokens by
  removing them from whitelist.

**Token Functions**
===================

**Standard Token Functions**
----------------------------

Functions for the stablecoin token implementation which are common to the [*FA2 Tezos
Token Standard*](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/76d5f3791bfbfe3c9bf95ad5ec5fc6cbeeca2d0e/proposals/tzip-12/tzip-12.md). The
token implementation in general follows an [*event loop*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) pattern meaning that every parameter
handles an additional callback call describing what needs to be done with
its result.

**transfer**

Types
```
tokenId = nat

transferParam
  ( address :from_
  , address :to_
  , tokenId :tokenId
  , nat     :value
  )

transfer = list transferParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(list %transfer
  (pair
    (address %from_)
    (pair
      (address %to_)
      (pair
        (nat %tokenId)
        (nat %amount)
  )))
)
```

- Transfers given amounts of tokens between addresses.

- Each transfer must happen atomically, if one of them fails, then
  the whole transaction fail.

- Transfers must follow permission policies that are described above.

- The amount of a token transfer must not exceed the existing token
  owner's balance. If the transfer amount for the particular token
  type and token owner exceeds the existing balance, then the whole
  transfer operation fail.

- Core transfer behavior may be extended. If additional constraints on tokens
  transfer are required, FA2 token contract implementation may invoke
  additional permission policies. If the additional permission hook fails,
  then the whole transfer fail.

- Core transfer behavior must update token balances exactly as the
  operation parameters specify it. No changes to amount values or
  additional transfers are allowed.

- Sender and receiver addresses must be whitelisted.

- Contract must not be paused.

**getBalance**

Types
```
tokenId = nat

getBalanceRequest =
  ( address :owner
  , tokenId :tokenId
  )

getBalanceResponse =
  ( getBalanceRequest :request
  , nat               :balance
  )

getBalanceParam =
  ( list getBalanceRequest             :requests
  , contract (list getBalanceResponse) :callback
  )

getBalance = getBalanceParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson):
```
(pair %getBalance
  (list %requests
    (pair
      (address %owner)
      (nat %tokenId)
    )
  )
  (contract %callback
    (list
      (pair
        (pair %request
          (address %owner)
          (nat %tokenId)
        )
        (nat %balance)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- Returns current balance of mutliple addresses. It accepts a list
  of `getBalanceRequest` and a callback which accepts a list of
  `getBalanceResponse` which is conequently passed to it.

**getTotalSupply**

Types
```
tokenId = nat

getTotalSupplyResponse =
  ( tokenId :tokenId
  , nat     :totalSupply
  )

getTotalSupplyParam =
  ( list tokenId                           :tokenIds
  , contract (list getTotalSupplyResponse) :callback
  )

getTotalSupply = getTotalSupplyParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(pair %getTotalSupply
  (list %tokenIds nat)
  (contract %callback
    (list
      (pair %getTotalSupplyResponse
        (nat %tokenId)
        (nat %totalSupply)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

- Returns total supply for multiple tokens. It accepts a list of
  token ids and a callback which accepts a list of
  `getTotalSupplyResponse` which is conequently passed to it.

**getTokenMetadata**

Types
```
tokenId = nat

getTokenMetadataResponse =
  ( tokenId              :tokenId
  , string               :symbol
  , string               :name
  , nat                  :decimals
  , map (string, string) :extras
  )

getTokenMetadataParam =
  ( list tokenId                             :tokenIds
  , contract (list getTokenMetadataResponse) :callback
  )

getTokenMetadata = getTokenMetadataParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```
(pair %tokenMetadata
  (list %tokenIds nat)
  (contract %callback
    (list
      (pair %getTokenMetadataResponse
        (nat %tokenId)
        (pair
          (string %symbol)
          (pair
            (string %name)
            (pair
              (nat %decimals)
              (map %extras string string)
      ))))
    )
  )
)
```

- Get a list of token metadata for multiple tokens. It accepts a
  list of token ids and a callback which accepts a list of
  `getTokenMetadataResponse` which is consequently passed to it.

- The smallest amount of tokens which may be transferred, burned or
  minted is always 1.

- `decimals` describe the number of digits to use after the decimal
  point when displaying the token amounts and must not affect
  transaction in any way.

          (or
            (unit %optionalOwnerHook)
            (unit %requiredOwnerHook)

            (option %configApi address)
          )
        )
  ))))
)
```

- Get the descriptor of the transfer permission policy. This allows
  for external contracts to discover an FA2 contract's permission
  policy as well as to configure it. For additional information
  please refer to FA2 token contract specification.

- Some of the permission options require an additional configuration
  API which can be implemented either within FA2 token contract
  itself or in a separate contract.

Each address that participates in transfer is separated into 2 types:
`operator` and `owner`. `operator` is a Tezos address that initiates
token tranfser operation on behalf of the `owner` that actually holds
tokens.

  | RemoveOperator operatorParam

updateOperators = list updateOperatorParam
```

Parameter (in Michelson)
```

    ))
  )

```

  to all tokens (TODO: discuss).
